## Number Guesser

This is a project for completion during the break between Modules 3 and 4 at the Turing School of Software & Design.  It is intended as a self-directed introduction into Front End concepts, including heavy use of jQuery.

The first phase of the project allows for input fields for guessing a number and buttons for submitting and clearing a guess and a button for resetting the game.

The second phase of the project includes error messages for guesses outside of the range of possible answers or for non-numeric guesses.  Buttons are also disabled if there is nothing to clear or reset.

The third phase allows the user to specify a range for the numbers holding the guess and also adjusts the minimum and maximum values in the range by 10 each way after a win.

The project can be played via https://le3ah.github.io/number_guesser/
